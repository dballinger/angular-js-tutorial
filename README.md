# Angular JS Tutorial

The purpose for this project is to provide an overview of some of the key features in Angular JS.
The primary audience is the team working on a project in which I'm currently involved and as such,
the features presented here are those that fit most closely with the requirements of that project.
Some key features have been omitted for this reason.

Each part of the tutorial is contained in its own branch starting from step-1_binding.

## Topics
- Data binding
- Directives with inherited scope
- Services & promises
- Directives with isolated scope
- Validation
